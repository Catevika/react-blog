# This project is a from Dave Gray

https://github.com/gitdagray/react_resources

It is available only in development mode because it deals with a local json file as database

It uses the [easy-peasy](https://easy-peasy.vercel.app/) npm package to make using Redux easier

<br />

# How to use

Clone this repository, then in the project directory, you can run:

`npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json` starts the server to access the local database

It is available on [http://localhost:3500](http://localhost:3500)

<br />

Then, as this is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) project created with create-react-app:

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
